# Release Sudokuoku

The app identifiers are `com.platteration.sudokuoku` on iOS and Android. Confirm that these belong to your developer accounts before building.

## Browser publication

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs checks and exports with `/sudokuoku` as the URL prefix. It publishes through GitHub Actions on the default/release branch and `codex/ui-readiness-fixes-20261010`, and can be dispatched manually. GitHub Pages must use the GitHub Actions source. A browser preview is separate from a signed app-store release.

## Native build and submission

1. Resolve outstanding dependency-audit findings; keep the audit gate enabled. Run `npm ci` and `npm run check`.
2. Sign in to the correct Expo account with `npx eas-cli login`, then link this checkout with `npx eas-cli init`. Use the existing profiles in `eas.json`. Never commit signing credentials.
3. Build an Android tester APK with `npx eas-cli build --profile preview --platform android`. Obtain an iOS internal/TestFlight build through your Apple account.
4. Test cold launch, safe areas, portrait/landscape and tablet layouts, background/foreground recovery, force-close/reopen, sound, vibration, screen readers, focus, reduce motion and every cosmetic on physical devices. Browser emulation and Metro exports do not verify these.
5. Review [the listing draft](store-listing.md), supply support/privacy URLs and capture native screenshots. Review the final SDKs before answering store privacy/data-safety forms.
6. After device and account checks, build with `npx eas-cli build --profile production --platform all`; submit the correct signed builds with `npx eas-cli submit --profile production --platform ios` and `--platform android`. Store review remains external.

## Sudokuoku checks

Verify shift animations, phantom fading, reduce motion, challenge links and ghost racing. Web invitations retain the app host and repository path with a challenge hash; native invitations use sudokuoku://c/ for an installed app. Verify native scheme handling and cold-start challenge recovery on devices.

No real purchase, native device test, signed EAS build or store submission was performed by this cloud preparation.
